#' @details
#' Function \code{get_filtered_votes} reads filtered votes from a database.
#' The result of this function is an invisible data frame with statements' data.
#'
#' Possible filters:
#' \enumerate{
#' \item clubs - names of clubs. This filter is a character vector with elements
#' like for example: 'PO', 'PiS', 'SLD'. It is possible to choose more than one club.
#' \item dates - period of time. This filter is a character vector with two elements
#' in date format 'YYYY-MM-DD', where the first describes left boundary of period and
#' the second right boundary. It is possible to choose only one day, just try the same
#' date as first and second element of vector.
#' \item terms_of_office - range of terms of office's numbers. This filter is a integer
#' vector with two elements, where the first describes a left boundary of range
#' and the second a right boundary. It is possible to choose only one term of office,
#' just try the same number as first and second element of vector.
#' \item meetings - range of meetings' numbers. This filter is a integer vector with two
#' elements, where the first describes a left boundary of range and the second a right
#' boundary. It is possible to choose only one meeting, just try the same number
#' as first and second element of vector.
#' \item votings - range of votings' numbers. This filter is a integer vector with two
#' elements, where the first describes a left boundary of range and the second a right
#' boundary. It is possible to choose only one voting, just try the same number
#' as first and second element of vector.
#' \item deputies - full names of deputies. This filter is a character vector with full
#' names of deputies in format: 'surname first_name second_name'. If you are not sure
#' if the deputy you were thinking about has second name, try 'surname first_name' or
#' just 'surname'. There is high probability that proper deputy will be chosen.
#' It is possible to choose more than one deputy.
#' \item topics - text patterns. This filter is a character vector with text patterns of
#' topics that you are interested about. Note that the votings' topics are written like
#' sentences, so remember about case inflection of nouns and adjectives and use stems of
#' words as patterns. For example if you want to find votings about education (in Polish:
#' szkolnictwo) try 'szkolnictw'. It is possible to choose more than one pattern.}
#'
#' If you did not choose any filter, the whole database will be downloaded.
#' Note that, due to data size (<= ~150 MB) it may take few seconds / minutes
#' to download all votes.
#'
#' Because of encoding issue on Windows operation system, you also need to select
#' if you use Windows.
